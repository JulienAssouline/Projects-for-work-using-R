# Projects-for-work-using-R
R code I use for projects and articles I write.

These are some articles for which I've used R. If you do not see a file above with a link, then the R code was a personal project of mine. Probably making a chart, or exploring data for fun. 

They are in ascending order. So, "Baseball attendance analysis & Wins in baseball 1970-2017" is my first project, and "Height in baseball" is my latest project.
